TODO.txt - Spheres
Step 1:  World mechanics
The base idea was to have spheres and move around. That's now complete except for no-overlap spheres generation, and extra fancy movement options. (and smoother circles) (and colors)  <-- todo: polish this:
		- fix ellipses in place of circles
		- colors
		- no overlap?
		- fancy movement?
Step 2:
Inventories & polishing (inc menus), saving
		- keep track of centers

V pixel width * 2

todo:	V change coordinates to exact ship location
	V adjust displaying
	V make for temp variables coherent to what they actually represent
X modify movement direction based on facing direction
X turn camera differently based on facing direction - ex left - up vs right - up (maybe relative direction change)

keep spheres centers in memory in order to generate them apart from one another
V distance color shading
map rotation
V change map cells from int to char to save memory
fix ellipses instead of circles

colors:
slime
rainbow
nice pink

todo if I'm bored:
better circles
